This project is the outcome of a live coding exam at the university. Some functionalities may be incomplete due to the limited time, and prioritization was necessary to fulfill the provided instructions. Nevertheless, I believe it serves as a simple yet illustrative example of a basic app featuring user types and authentication.

The development stack includes Angular, Typescript, Bootstrap, and Firebase.

To run the project, clone the repository, navigate to the 'yanina-perez-app' directory, run 'npm i' to install dependencies, and then use 'npm run ng serve' to start the local host.

Happy coding!
